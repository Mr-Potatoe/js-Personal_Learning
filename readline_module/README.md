# Node.js Number Addition Script

This Node.js script demonstrates how to handle user input from the terminal, perform basic arithmetic operations, and display the results. The script prompts the user to enter two numbers and calculates their sum.

## Overview

This script uses the `readline` module to interact with the user via the terminal. It prompts the user for two numbers, performs an addition operation, and outputs the result.

## Features

- Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- Calculates the sum of the two numbers.
- Displays the result in the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## File Structure

- `index.js`: The main script file that contains the code for prompting user input and calculating the sum.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you are working with a repository, clone it using:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change to the directory where `index.js` is located:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   Execute the script using Node.js:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter the numbers.

## Code Explanation

Here's a detailed breakdown of the `index.js` file:

```javascript
const readline = require('readline');

const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout
});
```

- **`require('readline')`**: Imports the `readline` module to handle user input.
- **`readline.createInterface()`**: Creates an interface for input and output.

```javascript
rl.question('enter first number :', (num1) => {
    rl.question('enter second number :', (num2) => {
        console.log(`the sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2)}`);
        rl.close();
    })
})
```

- **`rl.question(prompt, callback)`**: Prompts the user with a message and executes the callback with the user's input.
  - The first call prompts for the first number.
  - The second call, nested inside the first, prompts for the second number.
  - **`parseInt(num1)` and `parseInt(num2)`**: Converts the input strings to integers.
  - **`console.log()`**: Displays the result of the addition.
  - **`rl.close()`**: Closes the readline interface.

## Error Handling

The script assumes that the user inputs valid numbers. To handle non-numeric inputs or other errors, you would need to add additional validation and error handling logic.
